# Halite-Kaggle-Competition
This repo is a set of tools to build and train a multi-agent reinforcement learning agent to compete in the Halite Kaggle competition. This still needs a lot of work, but should be still dont' have the process running to where I want it to be, and have halted progress on this for other projects, but I wanted to take a break and see what I have learned and publish this so that i can go back and wrok on this when i am more experienced with reinforcement learning. 

Sample agents:
Below are the results from training the agents thus far. There will still need to be trained more - work still might need to be done in testing out different paramaters and architectures. 

# Running agents on AWS
To run the agent, you should run the instance. After running an instance, the correct environment neesd to be set up 

# Neural Net Architecture: 
The input is given to the neural net from a 2x2x21 vector, . The first channel is x
